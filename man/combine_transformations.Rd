\title{Combine Multiple Transformation Matrices}
\usage{
combine_transformations(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{A variable number of matrices to be combined. These matrices should
be compatible for matrix multiplication (i.e., the number of columns of one
matrix should match the number of rows of the next).}
}
\value{
A matrix representing the combined transformation. The output is the
  result of multiplying all input matrices in reverse order.
}
\description{
This function takes any number of matrices and computes their combined
transformation through matrix multiplication. The matrices should be provided
in the order they are applied.
}
\examples{
M1 <- matrix(c(1, 0, 0, 1), nrow = 2)  # Identity matrix (no transformation)
M2 <- matrix(c(0, -1, 1, 0), nrow = 2) # 90-degree rotation matrix
M3 <- matrix(c(1, 0, 3, 1), nrow = 2)  # Translation matrix (move by 3 on x-axis)

M <- combine_transformations(M1, M2, M3)
}
